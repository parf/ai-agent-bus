# R1 questions

## Open questions

Only unresolved choices live here. Accepted answers and their threads are in
[decisions](DECISIONS.md#recorded-decisions).

## Short prompts

Choices for the [shorter prompts plan](short-prompts.md#proposal), to discuss with the owner.

- ❓ Q183 Where the protocol card lives
  - Options: inline in the MCP instructions, read once at start; or a short doc the instructions tell the session to read; or both, with the instructions holding the minimum
  - Impact: inline costs its bytes on every session start, but cannot be skipped

- ❓ Q184 How strict the message style is
  - Options: guidance in the card only; or also a soft size hint from the face, such as a warning when a body repeats the push header or exceeds a length
  - Impact: guidance alone is free but easy to ignore; a face check is code for a style rule

## Agent capabilities

- ❓ Q191 How an agent says which asks it answers, so callers stop asking agents that cannot answer
  - Context: the web and doctor send `help-json`, `help-config`, `help-secret` and `mcp` to every agent; a plain agent or a live AI session cannot answer some of them and the caller waits out its deadline (owner, 2026-10-26: "decide how to pass what an agent can do, so we do not ask dumb agents what they cannot do"). [RT23](TODO.md#bundled-agents)
  - Minimum (owner): every agent MUST answer `help`
  - Options: the `help` answer carries one machine-readable capabilities line, for example `Asks: help help-json help-config help-secret mcp`, and callers read it before asking further (owner's "read capabilities from --help", recommended, no new ask or record field); or a separate `capabilities` ask returning the list as JSON; or the list stored on the record at registration so callers need no round trip
  - Impact: the help line keeps the daemon out of describing agents (constitution § agent self-description) and needs no new wire field, at the cost of one `help` round trip before any further ask; a record field saves that trip but makes the daemon carry agent self-description
