# TODO: RAG service

## Objective

Build the [RAG service](README.md#rag-service) from agents as building blocks:
blocks first, then the app on top. Owner, 2026-10-27: "move it to R1 and give it
to xAB; start with block building; use MD as plan; go over each step".

## Process

**xAB (`#codex/xab`) controls the plan's execution**; **xAB2 (`#codex/xab2`) builds R.3 and R.4 in parallel**, under the same process, and xAB folds its results into this file (owner, 2026-10-27: "it should
control plan execution, mark done items, and do review after meaningful progress").

1. One step at a time. Before code, xAB writes the step's plan here, under the step,
   in a few lines: shape, files, tests, mutants. `#claude/ab2-review` reviews it before code starts (from R.2; the manager approved R.1).
2. Each step lands under [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md#verification):
   - mutants for ⚠️ parts (parsers, network input, credentials);
   - the normal gate under the `smoke-gate` lock;
   - a bump: the shared version for a block, the [RAG's own version](README.md#versioning) for `#rag`, automatic, with a changelog line;
   - deploy only that component, then `check-deploy`.
3. xAB keeps this file current: it marks a step ✅ when it lands, moves its detail to
   [DONE](DONE.md) with the version, commit and gate numbers, and starts the next.
4. After meaningful progress (a finished block, or each `#rag` step), xAB asks the
   read-only reviewer `#claude/ab2-review` to review it, fixes or answers every
   finding, and records the result in DONE.
5. xAB reports each landed step to the manager, who reports to the owner.
6. No real provider call (Voyage, OpenRouter) and no live data without the
   owner's approval. Tests use fakes.
7. A choice for the owner goes to [questions](../QUESTIONS.md#rag-service), never picked silently.

## Steps

Blocks first (R.1–R.4), then the app (R.5–R.9).

- ✅ R.1 `#voyage`: built and deployed in 0.9.123 — [result and review](DONE.md#r1-voyage-proxy)

- ✅ R.2 `#ai` typed decisions: built and deployed in 0.9.124 — [result and review](DONE.md#r2-ai-typed-decisions)

- ✅ R.3 External Qdrant store: RD131 removal and rootless local deployment completed in 0.9.127 — [result and superseded history](DONE.md#r3-external-qdrant-store)

- ☐ R.4 `#qdrant`: a transparent proxy to the Qdrant HTTP API
  - Builds: pass-through of any Qdrant API path with the key added from the runner env, as `#voyage` does; no logic of its own
  - Acceptance: a collection is created, a point upserted and found through the bus; a path outside the API is refused; the key is in no reply or log
  - Mutant: drop the key, or allow a path outside the API; a check must fail

- ☐ R.5 Keyword trial, settling [Q194](../QUESTIONS.md#rag-service)
  - Compares Qdrant's built-in BM25 with the agent's own sparse vectors with stemming, on the owner's real Russian and English texts
  - Needs: a sample from the owner; the results go into the question, and the owner picks
  - Output: a short report under `done/`; no product code

- ☐ R.6 `#rag` core: CRUD and prompts
  - Builds: `upsert`, `get`, `list`, `delete`, and the prompt methods; Jev labels on upsert through `#ai`; embeddings through `#voyage` when absent; the read cache; idempotent point ids; chunking by mime-type
  - Acceptance: an upsert twice leaves one record; a delete by namespace and table removes only that; a Jev or Voyage failure fails the upsert and stores nothing; a prompt write invalidates the cache, and a cache hit makes no daemon call
  - Mutant: a duplicate on re-upsert, a delete beyond its filter, a stale prompt after a write, or a store despite a failed classification; a check must fail

- ☐ R.7 `#rag` search
  - Builds: hybrid `search` with filters and optional rerank, the keyword half chosen by R.5
  - Acceptance: on a fixture set, filters hold exactly; a keyword-only match and a meaning-only match both appear; rerank reorders; hits carry the agreed fields

- ☐ R.8 `#rag` extras: `complete`, `similar`, `count`, `classify`
  - Owner to confirm the list before this step

- ☐ R.9 Summary, docs and end-to-end
  - Builds: the optional summary chunk through `#ai`; a user guide under `docs/agents/`; one end-to-end run on the owner's data, approved by the owner
